### Description
__*A webpage that calculates factorials.*__

Another Epicodus exercise:
* A factorial is an operator that multiplies a number by all of the positive integers less than that number. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

* By definition, 0! = 1.

* Make a web page to compute factorials. Do it without recursion, and then try it with recursion if you're up for a challenge. (Look online for info on recursion.)
